Just link the dotfiles with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/joaquingx/dotfiles
  $ cd ~/dotfiles
  $ stow *
```

##Thanks and resources
[/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) is a great place for learning about customization. I have some files that are

I recommend read this [post](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) if you are new in this shit(like me).
